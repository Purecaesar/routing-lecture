    "name": "The War of the Worlds",
    "description": "Following the blockbuster film, this version of the classic story is ideal for younger readers in an easy to read abridged format. \"Classic Starts[trademark]\" is in its 5th printing - with more than half a million copies sold! It is aimed at children aged 7 to 9 years old. Hot on the heels of the blockbuster film comes a version of H.G. Wells' chilling tale of alien invasion that every child can enjoy. It begins as the sky lights up with bright cylinders from Mars that look like falling stars - and continues as the Martians emerge from their vessels with machines of fire and deadly smoke. Wells's depiction of a city in panic - written in 1898 - still remains shockingly contemporary.",
